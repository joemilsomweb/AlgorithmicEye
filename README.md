#Algo-Eye !!!WORK IN PROGRESS, ITS STILL UGLY!!!

An Algorithmic(ish) Eye(and eventually face) generator (very much a work in progress)

First attempt at creating an Entity Component System type architecture in JS,
not neccessarily perfect but the separation of data concerns into components and avoidance of 
massive classes so far has been useful. 

Also testing out using Webpack as a bundle generator (as opposed to grunt) with the built in ES6 transpiler.
I like it so far....
